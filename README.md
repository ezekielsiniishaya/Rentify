## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔐 Authentication

- Landlords and tenants register using distinct forms.
- User roles are identified and stored using `localStorage`.
- Auth is email-based, stored and verified via Supabase.

### 🏨 Lodge Management

- Lodges can be created, edited, or deleted by landlords.
- Each lodge can have multiple images.
- Images are stored in Cloudinary; references are saved in the DB.
- Tenant homepage fetches only **verified** lodges.

### 🔍 Search & Filter

- Tenant and landlord profile pages support dynamic filtering:
  - By **name**, **price**, **room count**, or **area**
  - Area list is dynamically fetched from the database
- UI adapts input type based on filter selected

### 🗂️ Reviews & Favorites

- Tenants can review lodges they've viewed
- Reviews are shown on lodge detail pages
- Favorite lodges are stored per tenant, with add/remove capability

### 📨 Feedback

- All users can send feedback to the admin
- Feedback is viewable by admin for further action

## ⚖️ Maintenance Guide

### 1. **Environment Variables**

Ensure the following variables are set:

```
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
RENDER_URL=  # If needed for deployed backend API
```

### 2. **Dependencies**

In `backend/`:

```
npm install
```

### 3. **Run Locally**

Start backend:

```
cd backend
node server.js
```

Open frontend: Open `frontend/index.html` directly or host it via a local server.

### 4. **Database Management**

- Use Supabase dashboard to manage tables:
  - `users`, `lodges`, `favorites`, `reviews`, `feedbacks`, `areas`
- Regularly backup the database from Supabase

### 5. **Image Cleanup**

- When lodges are edited or deleted, removed images are also deleted from Cloudinary
- Ensure Cloudinary API credentials are kept secure

- Booking functionality with notifications
- Pagination and advanced filtering
- Admin analytics dashboard (lodges per area, popular searches)
- Lodging verification via document upload
- Tenant authentication via school email or ID
- PWA (Progressive Web App) upgrade for offline capability

### 🧪 Testing

- More unit and integration testing with tools like Jest or Mocha
- Frontend UI testing with Cypress or Playwright

### 🔐 Security

- Harden Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security) policies
- Add rate-limiting middleware to prevent abuse
- Encrypt sensitive data on the backend
